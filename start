# User enters some numbers in expected field (those numbers are separated with comma). After entering data convert those numbers to the list. 
# Then calculate and print: biggest and lowest number from the list, average value, then create a list that contains olny numbers greater then the average value and then print that new list. 

#Importing modules and defining variables
